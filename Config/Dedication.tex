%In dedication to
I dedicate this work to my loving parents and my supportive friends. A very special thank you to my 
mother Shagufta Khizar and my father Khizar Hayat Khan, whose exceptional support and overwhelming 
throughput my time here away from home has nothing but been a blessing to me. I would also like to 
mention my friends Pseudo, GM, Paitha and Moi for making this journey of graduate studies on a 
foreign soil considerably easier to progress. I am very thankful to have these people in my life 
and I owe a significant portion of my success to them.
