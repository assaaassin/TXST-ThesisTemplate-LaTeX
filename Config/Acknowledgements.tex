Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor Dr. Anne H. Ngu, for her guidance and 
expertise over the course of this thesis. I would also like to thank all the faculty and staff members of 
the Department of Computer Science for providing an excellent research and learning environment. \\
I would like to express my appreciation for my friends and colleagues, especially Dr. Junye Wen, for 
being an amazing friend and helping me transition to the US. Lastly, I am extremely thankful for my family 
for being an immense pillar of support throughout my time here, even if they were thousands of miles away.
