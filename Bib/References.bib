abstract = {In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted great attention from academia,
industry, and government. IoT is considered to be a networking infrastructure that
can connect enormous physical objects and has great potential to extend mankind's
capabilities in monitoring, analyzing, and controlling the physical space using cyber
technologies. Extensive studies on IoT have been carried out and many IoT prototype
systems have been built. However, most of these systems are usually suitable for domain-specific
applications and operate in a local region. They are really “Nets of Things (NoT)”
as they miss mechanisms for large-scale interconnection. As such, how to build a globally
interconnected IoT is still an open problem. In this article, by reviewing the development
of the Internet, we derive a pathway that may lead to successful development and deployment
of a global IoT. We propose and examine a novel IoT architecture, namely, WInternet,
which aims at interconnecting small-scale domain-specific NoTs into a globally connected
IoT.},
